# Installing Remix

Welcome to Remix! Thank you so much for supporting us. We'll get you up and running in a few minutes.

If you run into any trouble, ask for help through one of the support channels.

## Cloning the starter project

For this tutorial we'll be using our express starter repo. We have other starters as well (firebase, vercel, etc.) and we're always working on more. Once you've got through this tutorial, check out the other starter repos and pick whatever hosting service provider you want.

```bash
# depending on how you're machine is set up with github

# can do this:
$ git clone git@github.com:remix-run/starter-express.git my-remix-app

# or this
$ git clone https://github.com/remix-run/starter-express.git my-remix-app

cd my-remix-app
```

## Edit `.npmrc`

In order for yarn/npm on your computer to be able to install Remix, you need to add your license key to the npmrc. You'll find it on <Link to="/dashboard">the dashboard</Link>.

It should look something like this:

```
//npm.remix.run/:_authToken=<your token>
@remix-run:registry=https://npm.remix.run
```

The first line allows npm to authenicate you with our npm registry when installing packages and the second line tells npm to use our registry whenever you are installing something with the npm scope `@remix-run`.

## Start the development server

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

Now open up your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you should see the hello world page!

## Two processes

We're using a tool called concurrently in package.json to run two processes in the same window with `yarn start`, but sometimes it's nice to split them out. In the first tab do:

```bash
$ remix run
```

This starts the development asset server. Then in another tab run

```bash
$ nodemon server.js
```

To run the express server. The reason we have a separate asset server from your app server is because Remix fits into any Node.js stack. Remix is just an endpoint on your server, rather than actually being your server.
