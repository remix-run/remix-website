# Conventions

There are a few conventions in Remix to be aware of.

## remix.config.js

This file must be named `remix.config.js` for Remix to find it when it starts up.

## app/entry-server.tsx

This is your entry into the server rendering piece of Remix. You must leave the file name as is.

## app/entry-browser.tsx

This is your entry into the browser rendering/hydration piece of Remix. You must leave the file name as is.

## app/root.tsx

This is your roto layout, or "root route" (very sorry for those of you who pronounce those words the same way!). It works just like all other routes: you can export a `loader`, `action`, etc.

## app/routes/\*_/_.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,md,mdx,cjs}

Any files in the app/routes directory will become routes in your application. Remix supports all of those extensions.

The filename minus extension becomes the "route id". So a file at `routes/foo/$bar.tsx` has the route id of `routes/foo/$bar`. These route ids will show up in future APIs for preloading resources.

## Dots in Route Filesnames

Adding a `.` in a route file will create a nested URL, but not a nested layout. Flat files are flat layouts, nested files are nested layouts. The `.` allows you to create nested URLs without needing to create a bunch of layouts.

For example: `routes/some.long.url.tsx` will create the URL `/some/long/url`.

## Route params with `$param` in files and folders.

The dollar sign denotes a dynamic segment of the URL. It will be parsed and passed to your loaders and routes.

For example: `routes/users/$userId.tsx` will match the following URLs: `users/123` and `users/abc` but not `users/123/abc` because that has too many segments. See the <Link to="../routing">routing guide</Link> for more information.

Some CLIs require you to escape the \$ when creating files:

```bash
touch routes/\$params.tsx
```

Params can be nested routes, just create a folder with the `$` in it.

## routes/404.tsx

When a route is not found, we use this file to render a 404 page. We don't like this convention because "/404" should be a valid URL (maybe you're showing the best BBQ in Atlanta!). This is what we've got right now though. This will change.

## Importing images with `img:`

You can import images assets with `import image from "img:./something.jpg". Check out the [image docs](/dashboard/docs/images).

## Importing css with `css:`

You can import css assets with `import styles from "css:./something.css". Check out the [styling docs](/dashboard/docs/styling).

## Importing any asset with `url:`

You can import any assets with `import assetUrl from "url:./something.mp3". Remix will return the public URL of the file and hash the name of the asset for long term caching.
