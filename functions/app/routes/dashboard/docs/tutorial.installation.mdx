# Installing Remix

Welcome to Remix! Thank you so much for supporting us. We'll get you up and running in a few minutes. Make sure you first [Buy a Remix Run License](https://remix.run/buy) if you haven't already.

If you run into any trouble, hit us up on the discord channel, you should have received an email about it. If you can't find that, [email us](mailto:help@remix.run) or hit us up on twitter: [@remix_run](https://twitter.com/remix_run).

## Cloning a starter project

The easiest way to get started right now is to clone one of our starter repos. Later we'll have a CLI to initialize everything you need but this works fine for now.

Take your pick, express or firebase, we'll have more later (azure, aws, etc.). If you just want to goof around, use express, it's easy to switch later.

```bash
# express
$ git clone git@github.com:remix-run/starter-express.git my-app

# or firebase, read the README inside for differences from
# this little guide
$ git clone git@github.com:remix-run/starter-firebase.git my-app
```

Your project should look something like this:

## Edit `.npmrc`

When you purchased, we added you to a private github npm package. In order for yarn on your computer to be able to install Remix, you need to add a Personal GitHub Access Token to the `.npmrc` file. If you don't have a token, [follow these instructions to create one](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token).

Once you have your token, open up `.npmrc` and add it. The file looks like this

```
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=[insert your token here]
@remix-run:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

The first line allows npm to authenicate you with GitHub when installing packages and the second line tells npm to use GitHub packages whenever you are installing something from the npm scope `@remix-run`.

If you don't see an `.npmrc` in the root of your repository, reference the README.md file, it will tell you where to find it (it varies by the cloud service provider you're deploying to).

## Start the development server

```bash
$ yarn && yarn start
```

Now open up your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you should see the hello world page.
