# Styling

While Remix has no CSS processing right now, we will be adding postcss soon. Even without those tools, the CSS approach in Remix is pretty powerful.

Two of the hardest parts of CSS for us have always been:

- writing styles that don't apply to unintended elements and
- knowing which styles you need for a page.

Using the route module `links` API, we can solve these problems easily with plain CSS.

## Adding styles to our gists routes

Go ahead and add the stylesheets `styles/team.css` and `styles/team.$member.css` and add whatever styles you want. The file names aren't important.

Now open up `routes/team.tsx` and add this:

```tsx
// if you want the type
import type { LinksFunction } from "@remix-run/react";

// import the CSS file with Remix's `url:` import assertion
import styles from "url:../styles/team.css";

// define the `<link>`s for this route
let links: LinksFunction = () => {
  return [{ rel: "stylesheet", href: styles }];
};
```

With the `url:` syntax, Remix will emit that asset to your browser build directory and fingerprint the file name for easy caching in production. The `styles` value is now a url string pointing to the asset.

The `links` export tells Remix which `<link>` tags to add to the document when this page is active (and which to remove when its not). Combining these two features we can add any stylesheets we want when this route is active, and automatically remove them when it's not.

Now go do the same in `routes/team/$member.tsx`:

```tsx
import type { LinksFunction } from "@remix-run/react";

import styles from "url:../../styles/team.$member.css";

let links: LinksFunction = () => {
  return [{ rel: "stylesheet", href: styles }];
};
```

When you're done, open the dev tools and watch the `<head>` component as you navigate around. You'll see the styles loading and unloading per route!

Since we're always using `<link/>` to add styles, we don't have a different code path for your styles in development vs. production like a lot of solutions. Also, your styles also always apply in the same order (order of your nested routes), so your dynamic style loading isn't at risk of different navigation paths like other solutions.

Again, we'll be doing more for processing CSS, but for now this is what we've got and we think it's great. Bring the CSS skills you already have, we'll make sure to load and unload it when the time is right!

<div className="next-prev-links">
  <Link className="next" to="../mutations">
    Data Mutations
  </Link>
</div>
