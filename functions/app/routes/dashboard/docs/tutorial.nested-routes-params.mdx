# Nested Routes and Params

Nested routes and layouts are a critical idea to understand in Remix, so we're going to build some UI with nested routes and data fetching.

We'll fetch a list of users for navigation, and then fetch their gists below it.

## Defining a "layout route" and loader

Layout routes are represented by two things on the file system: a file and a folder. The file is the React component, and the files inside the folder are the children that will render inside that component.

Create a folder at `routes/team` and a file at `routes/team.js`.

```
mkdir routes/team
touch routes/team.js
```

Now add this to `team.js`

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { Link, Outlet } from "react-router-dom";
import { useRouteData } from "@remix-run/react";

export default function Team() {
  let data = useRouteData();
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Team</h2>
      <ul>
        {data.map((member) => (
          <li key={member.id}>
            <Link to={member.login}>{member.login}</Link>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
      <hr />
      <Outlet />
    </div>
  );
}
```

We'll talk about that Outlet in a sec. First let's make a loader at `loaders/routes/team.js`.

```js
// you can point to whatever org you want, ofc
module.exports = () => {
  return fetch(`https://api.github.com/orgs/reacttraining/members`);
};
```

Alright, you should be able to visit http://localhost:3000/team and see a few users there.

## Index Routes

At the moment, this isn't a layout at all yet, it's just a list of the team. Let's render a child route inside of our team route.

Make a file at `routes/team/index.js`.

```bash
touch routes/team/index.js
```

And drop this into it:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { useRouteData } from "@remix-run/react";

export default function TeamIndex() {
  let data = useRouteData();
  return (
    <div>
      <h3>Team</h3>
      <p>
        Here we could show cool stats about the team or recent activity, etc.
      </p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Refresh the browser. Our "index route" is rendering inside the Outlet. The Outlet is a placeholder for all of the child routes whenever they match, while the layout around it persists.

Nested files = nested layouts.

When a layout route's URL is matched exactly, the "index" route will render into it's outlet, otherwise we'd have a blank section of the layout!

## Defining a child route with params

In the Team component we linked to each member of the team, let's go add the route to display their information. Make a file named `routes/team/$member.js`. If you're doing it from the terminal you may need to escape the \$, but text editors usually handle this just fine.

```bash
touch routes/team/$member.js

# might have to escape it
touch routes/team/\$member.js
```

Now add this to the file:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { useRouteData } from "@remix-run/react";

export default function TeamMember() {
  let user = useRouteData();
  return (
    <div>
      <h3>{user.name}</h3>
      <img src={user.avatar_url} width="50" />
      <p>{user.bio}</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Company</dt>
        <dd>{user.company}</dd>
        <dt>Location</dt>
        <dd>{user.location}</dd>
      </dl>
    </div>
  );
}
```

And now let's make the loader at "loaders/routes/team/\$member.js"

```js
module.exports = ({ params }) => {
  return fetch(`https://api.github.com/users/${params.member}`);
};
```

Note that Remix parses the params from the url (the $member portion of members/$member) and passes them to the loader.

You should be able to visit http://localhost:3000/members and click the members and watch the data update.

## Reviewing the end result

Open up the network pane in the devtools and watch how the cache headers tell the browser not to refetch the member data for one minute.

Also note that Remix is only fetching the data for the changed portion of the UI, the member. It doesn't need to refetch data from the "loaders/routes/team.js", because that part of the UI doesn't change. Remix has unique understanding of your app and can optimizations like this thanks to nested routes.

You can watch this behavior by adding a `<Link to="/team">Team</Link>` in your "app/App.js" file, visiting http://localhost:3000, opening the network tab, and watching the data requests come through the network tab.

<div className="next-prev-links">
  <Link className="next" to="../styling">
    Next up: Styling
  </Link>
</div>
