Building good software is largely about picking the the right tools for the right job. So when the Shop team at Shopify was tasked with building a web version of [Shop][apple-shop-app], they knew they needed a framework that allowed them to:

- Utilize existing tools and infrastructure
- Leverage code from the mobile clients
- Enable regular and rapid feature releases
- Scale to support millions of users
- Launch within a 3-month timeframe

That's a pretty big ask. Fortunately, Shopify employs some of the world's best developers who know how to pick a framework like the processionals they are.

This is the story about how [shop.app][shop.app] was built with Remix.

## The Shop App

</div>

Shop is an application that allows buyers to discover merchants and products, make purchases, and track their orders. Shop automatically aggregates shipping information across various delivery services. So whether it's Amazon or a small private company, no matter how the product is shipped, Shop will automatically track all of your packages in a single place.

Shop's usefulness has led to it being downloaded from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store 10s of millions of times. The Shop app has existed and served the needs of many customers for years, during which the web client ([shop.app][shop.app]) acted merely as a marketing site for the mobile apps.

Then, nearly 1 year ago, Shopify decided to explore what it would take to create Shop for the web.

## Building Shop for the Web

For a long time [shop.app][shop.app] was a simple landing/marketing page redirecting you to download the iOS or Android Shop app. There was no functionality ‚Äî no way to browse categories or products, no way to add items to your cart, and certainly no way to purchase those items.

Initially, the Shop team intended to develop a website that would have the same features as the mobile applications. However, a web version of Shop offers more than just another way for existing users to use Shop. There are certain advantages a web client offered in addition to the full-featured mobile apps, namely capturing new users and creating a faster feedback loop.

**Capturing more users**

The marketing pages were already drawing substantial traffic. While some visitors would proceed to download the app, offering the option to sign up or log in directly on the web broadened the scope for user retention.

**Faster feedback loop**

New versions of the website can be shipped multiple times a day, whereas the mobile application has a much longer waiting period due to the nature of mobile app releases.

Adding Shop Web would open up new possibilities for the team. It would enable them to run short-term ad campaigns and conduct daily experiments. The valuable user feedback gathered from these activities could then be utilized to enhance future versions of the mobile applications.

## Rapid development with Remix

The benefit to customers and Shopify were both clear, now all that was left was to makes sure it could be built right.

Often when a project grows, it starts out as a website and is then expanded into mobile counterparts. With Shop, it was the opposite; the way the mobile apps were built heavily influenced how the website had to be built.

The Shop team wanted to be able to use as much logic, styles, and UX from the Shop apps in Shop Web. They also wanted app and web developers to be able to easily collaborate and build features on both platforms.

The mobile versions of Shop, built in React Native, already had a substantial infrastructure in place for styles and data loading. Consequently, any framework chosen for the web needed to be use React. Moreover, it had to be flexible enough to accommodate the team's existing patterns, such as data fetching with [Apollo Client][apollo-client].

Finally, the pages needed to be Server-Side Rendered (SSR) for the best UX and SEO. While Shopify already had methods for building React apps with SSR, the Shop team was eager to experiment with Remix. They needed something that would allow them to launch quickly, and rapidly add new features and pages over time, and they already had a good experience quickly shipping with Remix.

### Shop AI

In February of 2023, shortly before the Shop Web work began, the lead developers on the team had a similar, but smaller scoped challenge: build a ChatGPT-powered shopping assistant on the web.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Shop smarter with <a href="https://t.co/7YAW0Tk8Rh">https://t.co/7YAW0Tk8Rh</a>! We&#39;ve brought our ChatGPT-powered shopping assistant to the web ‚Äî try it out, and don‚Äôt forget to sign in with Shop to save your faves üíú <a href="https://t.co/DpSdLEr4QD">pic.twitter.com/DpSdLEr4QD</a></p>&mdash; Shop (@shop) <a href="https://twitter.com/shop/status/1636022946127831040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 15, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

[Shop.ai][shop.ai] now redirects to [shop.app][shop.app], but at the time it was a single webpage showing off Shop chatbot built on top of OpenAI's newly released ChatGPT.

The team had ~1 month to build this site. They chose Remix, believing it would expedite and simplify the building of this straightforward website. Even though they didn't use many of the features that make Remix great (data fetching, routing, nested layouts, etc.), they still found it to be a fast and adaptable framework, which is exactly what they were looking for.

This positive experience gave them confidence to go with Remix for Shop Web.

### Monorepo with React Native

As mentioned, the Shop app is built with React Native. To ease development between the iOS, Android, and now Web version of Shop, the team uses a monorepo the source code of 3 clients.

The monorepo setup also simplifies migrating the existing marketing version of shop.app pages to the new experience. The monorepo setup meant that the fundamental infrastructure for linting, testing, releasing, CI/CD, etc. are all setup for the team to build on top of.

The Shop team found Remix flexible and easy to integrate into their existing setup, allowing them to start experimenting with building Shop Web on Remix.

### Get Sh\*t Done

At Shopify there's a term often used: Get Shit Done. Shopify is a company that prides themselves on building new and innovative things, and building them fast.

With Shop Web, the team was eager to get an initial version of the product pages launched as quickly as possible.

The team started building Shop Web in April, 2023. Because Remix was flexible enough to allow them to keep the architecture they had, and provided out of the box SSR, routing, loading patterns, and much more, the team was able to launch the initial product page in July, 2023.

**That's 3 months to Get Shit Done**

Remix was flexible enough to allow the Shop team to keep architecture they had. Remix didn't get in the way. Even though the team hasn't adopted everything Remix has to offer such as fully leaning on the Remix loading patterns and `defer`, the "guts out" approach of Remix means they could easily hook in their own patterns and libraries, while incrementally leveraging the bits of Remix they liked.

According to the Shop team, their ability to ship an initial version of Shop Web to millions of people all around the world in such a short amount of time couldn‚Äôt have been done without Remix.

### Even faster with Vite

One struggle the team did have using Remix was slow Hot Module Replacement (HMR). It took ~9s from the time a developer hit save to when they were able to see their changes reflected locally.

Due to these slow HRM times, the Shop team was eccstatic once the Remix team announced that they were [moving the compiler to a Vite plugin][vite-announcement]. They were so confident in the new Vite plugin and the DX benefits it would save their team, they didn't even hesitate until [it was marked as stable][vite-stable-announcement].

Migrating to Vite improved their HMR times to 2.3s.

These were just the initial numbers though. They had a number of small improvements the Vite migration made them aware of, mostly in terms of upgrading dependencies and converting some files from CJS to ESM, but the biggest one was the need to parallelize the [Tailwind][tailwind] build process, as it was a huge HMR bottleneck. Once they made this improvement they were able to further improve HMR times to 0.1s.

**That's 9s down to 0.1s, a 90x improvement**

Certainly, here's a conclusion for your blog post:

## Summing up

The journey of building Shop Web with Remix has been a testament to Remix's flexibility, DX, and scalability.

By leveraging the advantages of a monorepo setup, building on top of their existing infrastructure, and harnessing the rapid development capabilities of Remix, the team successfully transformed [shop.app][shop.app] from a simple marketing site into a fully functional web application.

The move to Vite further accelerated the development process, drastically improving HMR times and boosting productivity. The team was able to do this before Vite was even stabilized due to Remix's continuous delivery with [unstable and future flags][future-proofing-blog].

The Shop team was able to quickly and effectively deliver a complex and helpful web app to millions of users. What will you build with Remix?
