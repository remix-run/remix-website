# Route Loaders

Page data in Remix comes from a "loader" defined inside of your Route Module. While they live in the same file as the React Component, these loaders are only ever run server side. This means you can write sever side code right next to your component, like a direct connection to your database. Remix will remove the server-side code from the browser bundle, so you don't have to worry about it causing problems in the browser.

## Your First Loader

Inside of your `app/routes/gists.tsx` file, export a `loader` function that fetches the latest gists from the public:

```js
import React from "react";

// add this
import type { Loader } from "@remix-run/data";

// and this
export let loader: Loader = () => {
  return fetch("https://api.github.com/gists");
};

export default function Gists() {
  /* ... */
}
```

## Accessing data for a route

Now that we have a loader in place, you can access that data with the `useRouteData` hook.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import type { Loader } from "@remix-run/data";

// add this
import { useRouteData } from "@remix-run/react";

export let loader: Loader = () => {
  return fetch("https://api.github.com/gists");
};

export default function Gists() {
  // and this
  let data = useRouteData();
  console.log(data);

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Public Gists</h2>
    </div>
  );
}
```

If you visit "/gists" you should see a list of gists in both the browser console and the terminal since we're server rendering in development.

## Built on the Web Fetch API

You might be scratching your head at that last bit. Why didn't we have to unwrap the fetch response with the usual `await res.json()`?

If you've been around the Node.js world for a while you'll recognize that there are many different versions of "request" and "response". The express API `req, res` is probably the most ubiquitous, but wherever you go it's always a little different.

When browsers shipped the Fetch API, they didn't just create a spec for `window.fetch`, but they also created a spec for what a fetch sends and returns, `Request`, `Headers`, and `Response`. [You can read about these APIs on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).

Instead of coming up with our own API, we built Remix on top of the Web Fetch API. Loaders can return [Responses](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/Response), like this:

```js
return new Response(JSON.stringify({ teapot: true }), {
  status: 418,
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Cache-Control": "max-age=3600",
  },
});
```

So back to our question, why didn't we have to await the fetch and then await the `res.json`? Because Remix awaits your loader, and `fetch` resolves to response, and Remix is expecting exactly that type of object.

## Other return values

You don't have to built up a full response, loaders can return plain objects, you just lose control over your headers this way:

```ts
import db from "../db";

export let loader: Loader = () => {
  let arrayOfStuff = await db.query(someQuery);
  return arrayOfStuff();
};
```

Remix also has a json helper so you can set headers without having to worry about the content type and stringifying the body, etc. This is likely your bread and butter.

```js
import { json } from "@remix-run/loader";

export let loader: Loader = () => {
  let arrayOfStuff = await db.query(someQuery);

  return json(arrayOfStuff, {
    "Cache-Control": "max-age=60",
  });
};
```

## Why Cache-Control headers matter in loaders:

We saw that our routes can define their cache control, so why does it matter for loaders? It matters for two reasons:

First, your data usually knows better what the cache control should be than your route because the data changes more often than the markup. Because of this, the loader's headers are passed to the route's header function.

Open up `app/routes/gists.ts` and update your headers function like so:

```jsx
export function headers({ loaderHeaders }: { loaderHeaders: Headers }) {
  return {
    "Cache-Control": loaderHeaders.get("Cache-Control"),
  };
}
```

The `loaderHeaders` object is an instance of the [Web Fetch API Headers constructor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Headers)

Now when the browser or a CDN wants to cache our page, it gets the headers from our data source, which is usually what you want. Note in our case we're actually just using headers GitHub sent in the response from our fetch!

The second reason this matters is that Remix calls your loaders via `fetch` in the browser on client side transitions. By returning good cache headers here, when the user clicks back/forward or visits the same page multiple times, the browser won't actually make another request for the data but will use a cached version instead. This greatly speeds up a website's performance, even for pages that you can't cache on a CDN. A lot of React apps rely on a JavaScript cache, but browser caches already work great!

## Rendering the gists

Whew, okay, back to our app. Go ahead and map over that array however you'd like, here's a suggestion:

```jsx
// ...
export default function Gists() {
  let data = useRouteData();
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Public Gists</h2>
      <ul>
        {data.map((gist: any) => (
          <li key={gist.id}>
            <a href={gist.html_url}>{Object.keys(gist.files)[0]}</a>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Bit lazy on the type there, but hopefully you'll forgive us! Alright, refresh and you should see a beautiful list of gists (glist?).

## Data for meta tags

Like headers, meta tags pretty much always depend on data too, so Remix passes the data to your meta tag function. Open up `app/routes/gists.tsx` again and update your meta function:

```jsx
export function meta({ data }) {
  return {
    title: "Public Gists",
    description: `View the latest ${data.length} gists from the public`,
  };
}
```

Now if somebody posts a link to this site on social media, the preview will include the description with that data-driven meta description ðŸ™Œ.

## Finished Product

Here's the full code using all of the Route APIs we've introduced so far, as well as a quick type for a Gist.

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { useRouteData } from "@remix-run/react";
import type { Loader } from "@remix-run/data";

// Define the Gist type
interface Gist {
  id: string;
  html_url: string;
  files: {
    [fileName: string]: {
      filename: string;
      type: string;
      language: string;
      raw_url: string;
      size: number;
    };
  };
}

// Load data for this route and define some caching headers so that when the
// user navigates here multiple times it won't make the request more than once
// per 300 seconds
export let loader: Loader = () => {
  let res = await fetch("https://api.github.com/gists");
  let gists = await res.json();
  return json(gists, {
    headers: {
      "Cache-Control": "max-age=300",
    },
  });
};

// The title and meta tags for the document's <head>
export function meta({ data }: { data: Gist[] }) {
  return {
    title: "Public Gists",
    description: `View the latest ${data.length} gists from the public`,
  };
}

// The HTTP headers for the server rendered request, just use the cache control
// from the loader.
export function headers({ loaderHeaders }: { loaderHeaders: Headers }) {
  return {
    "Cache-Control": loaderHeaders.get("Cache-Control"),
  };
}

export default function Gists() {
  // useRouteData supports TypeScript generics so you can say what this hook
  // returns
  let data = useRouteData<Gist[]>();
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Public Gists</h2>
      <ul>
        {data.map((gist) => (
          <li key={gist.id}>
            <a href={gist.html_url}>{Object.keys(gist.files)[0]}</a>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```
