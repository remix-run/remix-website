  title: "Interactive MCP with React Router"
  description: >-
    Model Context Protocol is a powerful way to extend AI with context from the
    outside world, but right now the interaction with an AI is mostly 
    text-based. Text is fine for answering simple questions, but when it comes 
    to things like "help me find a good shirt for my kid's spider-man themed 
    birthday party" or "get me directions to the nearest taco stand," we need 
    much more. Clients like ChatGPT do have UIs for maps and things, but it's 
    pretty limited and bespoke because it's built case-by-case by ChatGPT 
    engineers.


    As we extend the model with more context and capabilities via MCP, we can 
    also extend it with a proper user interface using React Router and MCP UI 
    getting the best of both worlds. A powerful agent + a great UI.


    In this talk, Kent will demonstrate how to create an MCP server with React
    Router and expose great UI capabilities to the model. We're still early days
    for this, but the future is going to be awesome.

  description: >-
    Sidekick is Shopify's AI Assistant that lives inside the Shopify Admin,
    transforming how hundreds of thousands of merchants manage their businesses.
    Building on the architectural remixing of the Admin, we'll explore how this
    foundation allowed Sidekick to flourish as more than just another
    chatbot—it's
    a production-ready AI assistant that can fill forms, navigate workflows,
    generate content, create customer segments, and even edit themes.


    This talk takes you through the journey of building an AI assistant that
    goes far beyond text responses. We'll dive into the unique challenges of
    integrating conversational AI into a complex, mission-critical business
    platform where merchants rely on Sidekick to manage millions of dollars in
    commerce.

  description: >-
    Remix 3 is a look into the future of web development.


    The spirit of Remix has always been simplicity, elegance, and fun in
    programming. With Remix 3 we've rebuilt from the ground up, focusing on
    moving the web forward and helping you build faster and enjoy it more than
    ever, often with the help of AI.


    Modern web development has become fragile. Bundlers and extra layers of
    abstraction make it harder to understand what's really happening in your app
    and more complicated to deploy it. Remix 3 takes a different path. We're
    rethinking what it should feel like to build full stack applications entirely
    in JavaScript, with a unified story around state management, client and
    server communication, hydration, and a complete toolkit for working across
    the network boundary.


    Michael and Ryan were some of the first to embrace and evangelize React back
    in 2014. Now we're excited to share what comes next.
