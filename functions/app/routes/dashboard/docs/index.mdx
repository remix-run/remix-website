# Welcome to Remix!

Thank you for supporting Remix, we're so glad you're here!

## Getting Started

First things first, do the <Link to="/docs/tutorial/installation">getting started tutorial</Link>. We also highly recommend reading the <Link to="/docs/routing">Routes</Link> guide, nested routes are a big deal in Remix.

We're in beta so the docs are still incomplete but we're working on it :D Please be kind.

## Getting help

You should have been invited to the discord channel. If not, please [email us](mailto:help@remix.run). We are staying pretty active in there with our beta customers and appreciate all of your feedback and patience.
