Open source and open development don't always go together. I know because I've personally done a lot of _open source_ but not enough _open development_.

OSS Capital's [Joseph Jacks](https://twitter.com/JosephJacks_), who led our seed round of funding, said something that has stuck with me ever since he said it:

> You are building something that is generationally important

(<small>No pressure ðŸ˜…</small>)

I believe it. But Remix can't become a generationally important technology without being community driven, and it can't be community driven if it's not developed in the open.

Today we are completely opening up our development process.

- No invisible roadmap
- No surprise features
- No wondering when a bug is going to be fixed
- No private issue tracker <small>(goodbye Linear ðŸ˜¢ it's not you, it's me)</small>.

## Public Roadmap

Our [Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/remix-run/projects/5/views/1) is now public. It's a GitHub project that shows what we've got planned, in progress, pre-release, and recently shipped. You can easily see if your bug is getting fixed, your pet feature is coming soon, or know when you can try out pre-released features using our nightly builds.

## Open Development Process

To make our development _community driven_, we'll be doing all of our planning in the open and encourage developers using Remix to participate. Here's how features get into the Roadmap.

1. **Contributors** (that's anybody!) add a Proposal to [Remix Proposals](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/discussions/categories/proposals) or [React Router Proposals](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/discussions/categories/proposals).
2. The Remix **Admin Team** accepts Proposals in the Roadmap Planning meeting.
   - Proposals are accepted when the Admins create an **Issue** from the Proposal and add the issue to the Roadmap.
3. The Admins assign an **Owner** to the issue.
   - Owners may be contributors from inside or outside of the Remix team
   - Owners are responsible for shipping the feature including all decisions for APIs, behavior, and implementation.
   - Owners organize the work with other contributors for larger issues.
4. Owners create an **RFC** from the Proposal and then development can begin.

In other words: Proposal â†’ Roadmap â†’ RFC â†’ Develop â†’ Ship

For more details on how to participate, see the [Contributing Page](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/blob/main/docs/pages/contributing.md).

## Roadmap Planning Live Stream

Not only is the development opening up, but we'll be live streaming our Roadmap Planning meeting too:

- Watch the stream on our [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/Remix-Run/streams)
- Remix Admins will review Proposals and verified bugs and add them to the Roadmap.
- Other members of the Remix team and outside collaborators will often attend.
- Everybody is invited to participate in our [Discord](https://rmx.as/discord) channel

That's it! We'll see you on GitHub ðŸ¤—
