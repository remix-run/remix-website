Today we are happy to announce $3M in funding for [Remix](https://remix.run), the framework that helps you build better websites. The round was led by [OSS Capital](https://oss.capital/), with participation from Naval Ravikant, Ram Shriram, and Sahil Lavingia.

Since opening shop at [React Training](https://reacttraining.com) in 2015, we have helped thousands of teams all over the world be successful with React. And we've helped millions more through our open source work on [React Router](https://reactrouter.com), Reach Router, and Reach UI. In fact, **7 out of 10 times someone runs `npm install react-dom`, they also install React Router** (or Reach Router). Our open source software runs websites at Netflix, Apple, Google, Walmart, Airbnb, Twitter, and many, many others.

But we are just getting started.

## Open Source

For the past 18 months we've been working on [Remix](https://remix.run). Last October, we launched a "supporter preview" and we have been overwhelmed by the support we received. Ryan and I could both earn normal developer salaries from Remix subscriptions, but we want to take it a lot further. We want to make Remix available to everyone. With the funding announcement today, we are closing our supporter preview and announcing that **Remix will soon be released under the MIT license**. We believe that releasing Remix as open source will drive innovation in the project and allow other frameworks to benefit as well from the progress we make. We are anxious to learn from, and give back to others.

## Web Standards, Modern UX

So how exactly is Remix different from other frameworks? Instead of focusing on static sites, Remix starts with first principles like HTTP status codes and methods, HTTP caching, HTML prefetching of data, CSS, and other resources, the web `fetch` API, server rendering of pages with appropriate `<meta>` information for SEO, and much more. Our cache is the HTTP cache. Our "not found" pages are served with a 404. Our data mutations story is built around HTML `<form>`s. Progressive enhancement is a viable strategy. Many Remix sites don't even need JavaScript to work by simply letting the browser handle the UX.

To put it simply: Remix is built on a solid foundation of web standards.

But we think you should be able to add modern UX flair to your web apps and speed up the UX with JavaScript, so we've got you covered there too! Remix fully embraces the best parts about the modern web stack including client-side routing and rendering, optimistic UIs, seamless transitions between pages with resource prefetching and dynamic loading of code and data. Remix pairs these techniques with the concept of nested routing in React Router to build sites that maximize network efficiency and load instantly. Some of the most impressive web sites around today are built with React Router, and Remix is going to allow even more people to build similarly solid, incredible user experiences.

In addition to a best-in-class front-end stack, Remix provides a server story with zero vendor lock-in. The Remix server runs seamlessly on AWS, Google Cloud, Netlify, Vercel, and even non-Node.js environments like Cloudflare Workers. Want to run Remix as part of a larger Python, PHP, or Rails app hosted on EC2? No problem. Want to deploy your app at the edge and use Cloudflare Workers KV Storage or Durable Objects? You can do that too. Remix fits into your existing architecture.

We'll say a LOT more about Remix very soon. For now, just know that the future of Remix is secure and OPEN!

## Thank you, Remix Supporters

Remix would simply not exist without the support of our early adopters who bought a license in the last year. You've stuck it out with us through all twenty of our prereleases (!) and have truly made Remix more than the two of us could have ever imagined on our own. Sincerely, thank you.

Our goal in the coming year is to help more people than ever build amazing experiences on the web, with Remix or without it. We have a talented team and a smart, engaged community. We are ready to explore and push the limits of what's possible in 2022.
