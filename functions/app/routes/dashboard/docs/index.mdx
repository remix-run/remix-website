# Welcome to Remix!

Thank you for supporting Remix, we're so glad you're here!

## Getting Started

First things first, do the <Link to="tutorial/installation">Quickstart Tutorial</Link>. When you're done with that, we highly recommend reading the <Link to="routing">Routes</Link> guide, nested routes are a big deal in Remix.

We're in beta so the docs are still incomplete but we're working on it!

## Getting help

The <Link to="/dashboard/support">Support</Link> page lists several resources to get help, check it out if you're stuck.

We are staying pretty active on the issue tracker and the discord channel with our preview customers and appreciate all of your feedback and patience.
