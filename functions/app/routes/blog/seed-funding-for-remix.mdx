Today we are happy to announce $3M in funding for [Remix](https://remix.run), the framework that helps you build better websites. The round was led by [OSS Capital](https://oss.capital/), with participation from Naval Ravikant, Ram Shriram, and Sahil Lavingia.

Since opening shop at [React Training](https://reacttraining.com) in 2015, we have helped thousands of teams all over the world be successful with React. And we've helped millions more through our open source work on [React Router](https://reactrouter.com), Reach Router, and Reach UI. In fact, **7 out of 10 times someone runs `npm install react-dom`, they also install React Router** (or Reach Router). Our open source software runs websites like Netflix, Apple, Google, Walmart, AirBnB, Twitter, and many, many others.

But we are just getting started.

For the past 18 months we've been working on [Remix](https://remix.run). Last October, we launched a "supporter preview" of Remix, and we have been overwhelmed by the support we received. With the funding announcement today, we are closing our supporter preview and making another announcement: **Remix will soon be released under the MIT license**. We believe that releasing Remix as open source will drive innovation in the project and allow other frameworks to benefit as well from the progress we make. We are anxious to learn from, and give back to others.

So how exactly is Remix different from other frameworks? Instead of hopping on the jamstack train, Remix starts with first principles like HTTP status codes and methods HTTP caching, HTML prefetching of data, CSS, and other resources, the web `fetch` API, server rendering of pages with appropriate `<meta>` information for SEO, etc.

Our cache is the HTTP cache. Our "not found" pages are served with a 404. Our data mutations story is built around HTML `<form>`s. Progressive enhancement is a viable strategy. Most Remix sites don't even need JavaScript unless they are doing fancy client-side transitions.

You get the idea. Remix is built on a solid foundation of web fundamentals.

But if you *are* doing fancy client-side stuff, well, we have you covered there too! Remix fully embraces the best parts about the modern web stack including client-side routing and rendering, optimistic UIs, seamless transitions between pages, and dynamic loading of code and data. Remix pairs these techniques with the concept of nested routing in React Router to build sites that maximize network efficiency and load instantly. Some of the most impressive web sites around today are built with React Router, and Remix is going to allow even more people to build those incredible experiences.

In addition to a best-in-class front-end stack, Remix provides a server story with zero vendor lock-in. The Remix server runs seamlessly on AWS, Google Cloud, Netlify, Vercel, and even non-Node.js environments like Cloudflare Workers. Want to run Remix as part of a larger Python, PHP, or Rails app hosted on EC2? No problem. Want to deploy your app at the edge and use Cloudflare Workers KV Storage or Durable Objects? You can do that too. Remix fits into your existing architecture.

We'll say a LOT more about Remix very soon. For now, just know that the future of Remix is secure and OPEN!

Our goal in the coming year is to help more people than ever build amazing experiences on the web, with Remix or without it. We have a talented team and an engaged, intelligent community, and we are ready to explore and push the limits of what's possible in 2022.
